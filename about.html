    QSearch is a project coordinated by Quidgest in partnership with the RTD FCT/UNL focusing on improving document management and access through three fundamental technologies:
    <ol>
        <li>Algorithms for textual document analysis in order to extract their metadata</li>
        <li>Advanced search and ranking algorithms</li>
        <li>Multifaceted search user interfaces</li>
    </ol>
    <p>These technologies arise from the necessities of document management users have in order to increase their productivity. The necessities fall into the strategies of information access optimization followed by many companies and e-government applications at international level.</p>
